# Data Standards (BIDS) and conversion
### mathiasg@mit.edu

layout: false
### Neuroimaging data is BIG

- MRI as a research tool has been used for over two decades.

--

- Different types of MRI scans within studies
  - Anatomical
  - Diffusion
  - Functional
---
### Managing this data

- Lack of data storage/organization standard in neuroimaging community.

--

- This can lead to problems:
  - harder to share data (even in same lab)
  - separate tracking of specific metadata when processing dataset
  - no way to automatically validate completeness of dataset
---
## [Brain Imaging Data Structure](http://bids.neuroimaging.io) (or BIDS)

   
I believe that all the previously proposed solutions (apart from those that require specific implementations) result in the comments being included in the output HTML, even if they are not displayed.

If you want a comment that is strictly for yourself (readers of the converted document should not be able to see it, even with "view source") you could (ab)use the link labels (for use with reference style links) that are available in the core Markdown specification:

http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link

That is:

[comment]: <>  <img src="assets/data2bids.jpg" width="100%" />
*Gorgolewski, K. J. et al. 2016*
???

who came up with this? over 5000 researchers.
---
### So what do I need?

- Full specification can be found [online](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/bids_spec1.0.0.pdf)

--

- [In-browser validator](http://incf.github.io/bids-validator) can easily check for you!
  - For HPC - can also validate through command line

???

run validator showing warnings/errors
---
### Now what?

<img src="assets/bids-apps.png" width="100%" />

???

over 20 apps!
---
### BIDS-Apps

- Each app self-contained inside own docker image
  - no hassle of installing/updating new versions
--

- [MRIQC](https://github.com/poldracklab/mriqc)

- [fMRIprep](https://github.com/poldracklab/fmriprep)
--

<object type="image/svg+xml" data="assets/t12mni.svg" width="100%">
</object>

???

mriqc - runs quality control measures on both structural and functional across either individual or group - outputs reports
fMRIprep - runs basic preprocessing with reports generated outlining how import steps affected the data
ALL RUN BECAUSE OF FACILITATION BY BIDS STRUCTURE
---
## Easiest way to convert to BIDS?

- Convert current files or..
--
<img src="assets/heudiconv.png" width="100%" />

--

[Heudiconv](https://github.com/nipy/heudiconv)

    - `Python 2`
    - `Nipype`
    - `dcmstack`
    - `dcm2niix`

Or if you have docker: `docker pull nipy/heudiconv`
---
### Sample conversion

  - Start out running heudiconv without any converter, just passing in dicoms.
  ```
  heudiconv -d $DICOMPATH/%s/*.dcm -f convertall.py -c none -s $YOUR_SUBJECT
  ```
--

    - Note: we are not designating a converter yet, but we'll be using the `convertall.py` found in the sample heuristics.
---
### Check the generated info!

  - Once run, you should now have a directory with your subject, and a sub-directory `info`.

    - In there, you can see a `dicominfo.txt` - we'll be using the information here to convert to a file structure (BIDS)
--

  <img src="assets/dicominfo.png" width="100%" />
---
### Put the guts in your heuristic!
  - For this example, we want to extract T1, diffusion, and the face matching task

--

  - First, define the keys
  ```python
  t1 = create_key('anat/sub-{subject}_T1w')
  dwi = create_key('dwi/sub-{subject}_acq-{acq}_dwi')
  facematch=create_key('func/sub-{subject}_task-facematch_run-{item:02d}_bold')
  info = {t1:[], dwi:[], facematch:[]}
  ```
--

  - And now for each key, look at the `dicominfo.txt` and set a unique criteria that only that series will meet. For example:
--

    ```python
    for idx, s in enumerate(seqinfo):
        x,y,sl,nt = (s[6], s[7], s[8], s[9])
        if (sl == 176) and (nt ==1) and ('T1_MPRAGE' in s[12]):
            info[t1].append(s[2])
    ```
---
### Test it out!
  - After setting rules for each key, re-run `heudiconv` with some added parameters:

--

    - `-c dcm2niix` - this sets the converter that will be used (dcm2niix is recommended)
    - `-f my_heuristic.py` - this tells heudiconv to look for the specific keys you defined when converting
    - `-b` - this flag tells `dcm2niix` to output BIDS metadata `json` files.
--

  - Something missing? Double check your `heuristic.py` and `dicominfo.txt`!
---
### Is it BIDS yet?
  - 90% there, but (currently) you will have to fix any errors from the validator.

<h2>BUT</h2>

  - A change to `heudiconv` will be coming soon that fixes most, if not all, of these problems.
